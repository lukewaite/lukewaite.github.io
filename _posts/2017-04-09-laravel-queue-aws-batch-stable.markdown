Following up my [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-01-laravel-queue-aws-batch %}) about the release of my [laravel-queue-aws-batch][batch_queue] plugin, I am pleased
to announce that I have tagged two stable versions for release.

<!--more-->

Version 1.0 has been tagged supporting Laravel 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

Version 2.0 has been tagged supporting Laravel 5.4.
