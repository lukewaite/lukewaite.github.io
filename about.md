Hello, I'm Luke

I'm a been a computer guy all my life, teaching myself how to program by working on the open source MUD engines that
were available during grade school.

These days my interest is less MUDs, more automation and infrastructure. I have a professional background in Software
QA, and these days I find myself wearing the DevOps hat.
